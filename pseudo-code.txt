It might help for now to manually add a few books to your array so you can see the display.

display on page:
1. manually add dummy-books to array
2. create function which...
  2.1. (loops through library array) {
  2.2. (for each book in array) creates and appends a new tablerow (to existing table)
  2.3. (for each book in array) creates 4 tablecolumns and appends to new tablerow.
  2.4. update textcontent of each row with data of appropriate book.}
